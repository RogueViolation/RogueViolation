# Ignelio / RogueViolation

#### We're back in black **BABY**!

Currently using C#, JS. Making a React app with a C# back-end to initially make a tool for myself for making a custom config file for a software I use.

Always open to new possibilities be it something new or already experienced.

I also have experience working with ASP.NET Core, .NET Framework+Core, API based communication, Azure DevOps, Git (duh), OpenShift.

Some experience with Windows Server Platform, Docker.

Development tools
* VSCode
* VS2019
* VS2022
* Git Extensions
* NP++
* Azure
* json2csharp

Usually making smaller tools to make my daily stuff easier.
