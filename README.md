# Ignelio / RogueViolation

#### We're back in black **BABY**!

Currently using C#, JS. Making a React app with a C# back-end to initially make a tool for myself for making a custom config file for a software I use.

[![Build status](https://dev.azure.com/RogueViolation/ToolbeltUtilities/_apis/build/status/ToolbeltUtilities-ASP.NET%20Core)](https://dev.azure.com/RogueViolation/ToolbeltUtilities/_build/latest?definitionId=4)

Always open to new possibilities be it something new or already experienced.

I also have some experience working with ASP.NET Core, API based communication, Azure DevOps, Git (duh), OpenShift.

Iâ€™m currently learning OpenShift

IMO I should really start doing some DB and start using Docker, but that is obviously for the future to come ðŸ˜„
